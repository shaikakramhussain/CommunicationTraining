		Summary and analysis of The Little Prince by Antoine de Saint Exupery
		****************************************************************************
This is a story about a man who crashes his plane in the Sahara Desert.  As he attempts to repair his plane, he encounters a little prince with golden hair.  

The prince shares that he is from a distant planet, a small planet with a rose and three volcanoes.  The prince then shares that he has travelled from planet to planet,
 meeting different and unique individuals.  

The man is dying of thirst and the prince suggests that they walk in the desert to find a well.  They eventually find a well and the man's thirst is quenched.

In the end, the prince returns to his planet and the man returns safely to civilization.

The majority of the story is immersed in a sense of isolation and solitude.The prince travels alone from planet to planet, each planet is occupied by one individual, 
and the man crashes his plane in the desert.  

However, the story's essence shifts from solitude to friendship when the prince learns what it means to be "tame" from a fox.   The fox explains that to tame 
someone or something means to set it apart from the others like it, to treat it special and as an individual.  The prince realizes that the rose on his planet is unlike 
any on Earth and he learns to cherish it, leading to his return to his planet.

The author also uses satire and caricatures to portray how different adults may view life.  As the prince travels from planet to planet, he meets people who are characterized 
by their extreme flaws, such as the proud king, busy banker, drunk, and lamplighter.  Each of these individuals views their world and the surrounding stars differently.

The author spends a lot of time talking about the stars.  Stars can represent life and in this story, the author illustrates that stars, or life, have different meanings to different people. 
 The prince views the stars as something that is free and to be enjoyed by everyone.  He encourages the man to view the stars as little bells.  But by the end, the author proposes that the 
stars can represent tears and sadness.





The main theme of The Little Prince is the importance of looking beneath the surface to find the real truth and meaning of a thing. It is the fox who teaches
the Prince to see with one's heart instead of just with one's eyes. Unfortunately, most adults have difficulty doing this.

The fox explains that one becomes responsible for what one has tamed, and the Little Prince realizes that he is responsible for his rose. The main lesson, then,
 is that the meaning of life can be found only in relationships.
