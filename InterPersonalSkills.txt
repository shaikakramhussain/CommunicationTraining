Why Are Interpersonal Skills Important?
Without interpersonal skills, everyday business would be very difficult, since almost all aspects of work involve communication.
Many jobs also involve collaboration and interaction with different types of people, and interpersonal skills are vital to make this happen.
Even if you have a very technical job, such as an IT role, you will need to interact with colleagues or clients regularly, 
often imparting complicated information or having to listen carefully to requirements. Having excellent technical capabilities 
on your resume won't necessarily be enough to get you the job.

1. Self-Confidence
Confidence will help you when communicating with others, as it ensures that you can convey your point clearly and will be listened to.

2. Work Ethic
Having a strong work ethic is viewed favourably by many recruiters. But what exactly does work ethic relate to?
Professionalism – This incorporates everything from how you present yourself through to your appearance and how you treat others.

3.Body Language
Eye contact
Facial Expressions
Gestures
Personal space
Posture and body position

4.Listening
When improving your interpersonal communication skills, the first thing you need to learn is to listen.
Failure to listen properly can have disastrous consequences, from failing to follow through on a manager’s instructions to not completing a customer’s request.
Active listening is a skill that will help you understand and learn from others and respond correctly to what they are telling you. 

5.Collaboration
Working collaboratively allows teams to work productively and deliver positive outcomes for clients and the business. Successful collaboration requires the ability to cooperate and respect each other.

6. Positive Attitude
Showing positivity, even in difficult situations, is important. Be positive from the moment you fill out the application form or write a covering letter through to the interview, your first day at work and beyond.
Never say anything negative about your current or past employer, even if you feel strongly about it.
Employees with a positive attitude are more likely to treat others positively, which creates a more harmonious working environment.
